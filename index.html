                <p><strong>About Myself</strong>:</p>

                <p>I currently live in New York City, and attending Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) - majoring in Multimedia Programming (MMP).</p>

                <p>In the past, I attended P.S 62 (elementary school), M.S 137 America's School of Heroes (middle school), and Forest Hills High School. I was an active student in high school by participating in many clubs; for instance, the Red Cross Club, Key Club, Animal Rights Club and Medical Club. Also, I challenged myself by partaking in the Math Team during my Junior year. I graduated high school with honors, and accepted an Advanced Regents Diploma. Then, I went on to further my education at Borough of Manhattan Community as a Multimedia Programmer.</p>

                <p>In the summer of 2017, I interned with WitMedia, a full service boutique media agency. I worked on their website, which was complemented on by their President, Clint White, and I landed a job. I now work for WitMedia as a Multimedia Programmer, who is currently creating a new website for Beech Hills Securities, a broker-dealer firm. Also, I created and designed EcoTaj Retreats website.</p>
